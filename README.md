The work in this repository is meant to find a relation between the IR luminosity and the AGN fraction by taking in CIGALE model fits.

The first file you should use is the DataSaver notebook, which allows the user to integrate a specific luminosity range, for my project this was 3-30 and 8-1000 microns.

The 3-30 notebook is specifically for the 3-30 range, but should work for any .csv file saved by the DataSaver file.
Just as the median plot notebook should work for any .csv file.

The SED_fit file is only there to be able to show the fits from CIGALE. Note that it is important that you know in which directory your CIGALE fits are located.
